### Hello, welcome to my profile!

I'm a hobbyist programmer that primarily works on Node.js and website projects.

‚ùÑÔ∏è Some of my projects:
- [Kisaragi](https://github.com/Tenpi/Kisaragi), a multi-purpose discord bot with over 300 commands ranging from website searching to music playing.
- The [website](https://github.com/Tenpi/Kisaragi-Site-React) for Kisaragi bot, which mainly contains the documentation for the commands.
- An online [music player](https://github.com/Tenpi/Music-Player) that can reverse, pitch shift, and time stretch audio in real time.
- [Hibiki](https://github.com/Tenpi/Hibiki), a twitter bot that tweets anime pictures intermittently. 
- [Uzuki](https://github.com/Tenpi/Uzuki), a reddit bot that finds the source of the post when mentioned.
- API wrappers for [Youtube](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube.ts), [Soundcloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundcloud.ts), [Pixiv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixiv.ts), [DeviantArt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deviantart.ts), and [Osu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osu.ts). 
- The [waifu2x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waifu2x) npm package to upscale images with node.js. 
- A [browser extension](https://github.com/Tenpi/soundcloud-extension) that can download tracks from Soundcloud. 
- Some [photoshop scripts](https://github.com/Tenpi/photoshop-scripts) such as deleting every other frame in a gif. 

‚ö° Technologies that I know:
- Javascript/Typescript
