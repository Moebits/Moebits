### Hello, welcome to my profile!

I'm a hobbyist programmer that primarily works on Node.js and website projects.

âœ¨ Some of my projects:
- Kisaragi, a multi-purpose discord bot with over 300 commands ranging from website searching to music playing.
- The website for Kisaragi bot, which mainly contains the documentation for the commands.
- An online music player that can reverse, pitch shift, and time stretch audio in real time.
- Hibiki, a twitter bot that tweets anime pictures intermittently. 
- Uzuki, a reddit bot that finds the source of the post when mentioned.
- API wrappers for Youtube, Soundcloud, Pixiv, DeviantArt, and Osu. 
- The waifu2x npm package to upscale images with node.js. 
- A browser extension that can download tracks from Soundcloud. 
- A photoshop script that deletes every other frame in a gif. 

âš¡ Technologies that I know:
- Javascript/Typescript
- HTML/JSON
- CSS/LESS
- Python
- SQL
- React

ðŸ¤” I might look into these someday:
- A personal website
- An image board website
- A VST plugin
