Hi, I am a web developer that has made a couple of apps and websites. 

My Apps: \
[Music Player](https://github.com/Tenpi/Music-Player), music player with reversing, time stretching, and pitch shifting effects. \
[Photo Viewer](https://github.com/Tenpi/Photo-Viewer), photo viewer with resizing/color correction effects. \
[Video Player](https://github.com/Tenpi/Video-Player), video player with reversing and time stretching effects. \
[Waifu2x GUI](https://github.com/Tenpi/Waifu2x-GUI), upscales images/videos. \
[Image Compressor](https://github.com/Tenpi/Image-Compressor), compresses and resizing images/gifs.

My Websites: \
[Moebooru.moe](https://github.com/Tenpi/Moebooru.moe), an image board website organized by tags. \
[Kisaragi.moe](https://github.com/Tenpi/Kisaragi.moe), website for my discord bot. \

Misc rant about something that really bothers me - AI "art".

AI "art" is sourced from stealing millions of artists works without any of their consent and feeding them into an ML algorithm. Then the companies are usually charging a subscription fee to use their AI tool for what is essentially theft with an extra step. 

It is honestly so cruel and disgusting that these companies are exploiting the hard works of artists for money. These ML algorithms cannot draw and are only being fed artwork and being told what it is. It would be impossible to create these tools without the artists works, and none of the artists who taught these AI how to draw will see a cent of what these companies are making off of their data.

It has none of my support and anyone who pays for AI "art" should be ashamed of themselves. I only care about art if it has real human love and compassion behind it.

I have to say that AI "art" has just really turned me off from programming in general. I don't really want to be associated with these people. Don't even call me a "programmer" or "coder", I am just an artist who happens to write some code sometimes.
